<h2 id="toc_1">What is Chatminion ?</h2>

<p>Better explained in the video.
    <iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CuVyldcQ0Kw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>It is  a comprehensive chat application, that is made for chatting inside an office. You can send text messages and video calls.
But there is a catch , you dont have to type and send messages , neither the reciepient . Curated set of messages , which are used more than 100 times in a day within a team or office are right inside the app.</p>

<p>Once you send a message, your reciepient will be shown with most possible replies to the message . Chatminion will also prepare an audio message based on the message you send and recieve(Its not just a message read out).</p>

<h4 id="toc_2">Some of the highlights include</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>98% ephemeral , your message flies from one end to the other and dies right there. It gets stored nowhere.
 The application stores only last two messages for threading(to remember the context). </p></li>
<li><p>Makes the recurring conversions , really quick .</p></li>
<li><p>Make video calls , the reciepient need not authorize the video call .when you want to talk to your team member , simply hit video call and you are there .</p></li>
<li><p>Video calls are plugin free and based on Web RTC and it is almost Peer to Peer .</p></li>
<li><p>The operational cost in the server side is extremely low . since no message gets stored anywhere.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_3">How chatminion works ?</h2>

<p>You can study that here . <a href="https://github.com/dineshswamy/chatminion-chrome-app">Chatminion(repo)</a> . You are welcome , to hack away that , all instructions are available there .</p>

<div id="is-this-an-alternative">
</div>

<h2 id="toc_4">Is this an alternative to other chat applications ?</h2>

<p>May or may not be , depends on the needs you have. We wrote this exclusively for people who work in teams .Teams that does development or looks after sales etc . We  have no intention of competing in the chat applications space .</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="toc_5">We are experimenting to see whether chatting really works this way and the results of the experiment are yet to come .</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Three months ago , i made a prototype working . It was working but  it was incomprehensible to distribute . Thats where we decided , okay lets make this is as a complete google chrome app and see what happens .</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="toc_6"><em>Doing a feature comparison between existing chat applications and Chatminion , wont fit. Chatminion is one of its kind . Though , It is still a tool for making conversation , the way  conversation happens is different .</em></h4>
</blockquote>

<p>But there are clear differences , and what chatminion can do </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Chatminion is not based on XMPP protocol its built on top of HTTP </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every message that is sent via chatminion can be attached a property with it( attribute )</strong> i.e The sender can control the behaviour and appearance of the message that is sent .You can do something like , </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Okay chatminion .  i dont want any reply from him/her for this message &quot; , by turning off the check box .</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>if you dont want chatminion to prepare an audio message for your reciepient , you can do that , by turning off the check box</em></p>

<div id="who-asked-you">
</div>

<h2 id="toc_7">Who asked you to write this ?</h2>

<p><strong>Nobody.</strong> Every day these things keep happening at my office </p>

<p>Everyday ,i saw my manager entering office and the first thing he asks me is this &quot;Whats your status ?&quot; and depending on the day , my reply would be &quot;Completed&quot; or &quot;Still working&quot; or &quot;need some time&quot; .</p>

<p>There is another manager ,who oversees sales team . every half n hour , he will shout(loud enough to be heard by everyone) at  his sales team &quot; XYZ ? Can we talk now ?&quot; and the reply would    be &quot;In 10 mins&quot; or &quot;Later&quot; or &quot;I m on call . will be coming&quot;</p>

<p>and finally my colleague </p>

<p>He ll be in another room , and he wont come out of his place very often .
he will shout whatever he wants to ask me and most of the time , i ll be wearing earphones , so the rest of the story is obvious. Someone will tap my shoulder,i ll remove my earphones , ask them what and blah blah .</p>

<p>I would like to thankyou for reading this post . I once again quote that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We made chatminion , because we imagined chatting this way will be intresting and i requote the following  </p>
