<h2 id="toc_0">What towermapify does ?</h2>

<p>Towermapify is a coverage map. The objective is to map  coverage strength of all the operators in india .
Whether they provide 3G or 4G or HSIA(high speed internet connectivity) in a particular region . If a user
needs to know whether 3G/4G/HSIA is available in a region ? or How good the coverage strength of particular operator is ? , the information can be found .</p>

<p><a href="http://towermapify.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Towermapify</a></p>

<h2 id="toc_1">1 internship month =  1 prototype throwaway + 1 Production version</h2>

<p>When i was briefed about the project , neither of us had no clue how we are going to do this .We only had data required for the map .</p>

<p>We started with Google Maps API combined with Google FusionTables . Your data will be hosted by the Google Servers .It will provide REST FULL apis to access the data . You need to write a client(HTML+CSS+JS) where you need to handle the data and put them in Map.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Growing requirements</h3>

<p>Once i got a prototype working , the requirements at komparify.com started growing , we badly required many features . But Fusion tables are not enough as they had limitations.</p>

<p>For example : You cant do a &quot;OR&quot; in the SQL query you send .Your table should be publicly available .</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Thrown far far away</h3>

<p>So days and days of work was thrown away and we finally settled down to define development stack.We decided use our own servers and make restful apis for data .</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Towermapify - Built on</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails </li>
<li>Google maps API V3</li>
<li>KML/JSON</li>
<li>HTML+CSS+JS</li>
<li>Rails Cells integration </li>
<li>MySQL</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_5">OverQuery algorithm</h2>

<h3 id="toc_6">Problem (A)</h3>

<p>We have a huge data containing latitude and longitude information of places all over india . if we
drop markers for all the places , it will do a catastropic damage to the performance,browser.
Takes huge memory , not a good idea.</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Work around (A)</h3>

<p>So , to decide what markers to drop . we get the bounding edges south west and north east of the map . With that , the query is for only the  places that resides inside the bounding box and then query again when the user does panning inside the map , with the new bounding box</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">Problem (B)</h3>

<p>The way we find the new bounding box after the user pans is by listening to the map-events . But the problem is that map-events fire for every small pan or zoom , making navigation inside maps terrible . If the mouse is just shaken inside the map , it does a query for the new bounding box and drops the markers again , giving a terrible user experience .
Also , server-client IO will be high .</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">Work around (B)</h3>

<p>This is the place where we went back to the drawing board and started writing rules that minimizes no of requests to the server and gives a good user experience .</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">Overquery</h3>

<p>My boss and co-founder of komparify.com Jigar doshi , formulated this approach.He knew of this approach thourgh his
experience at Amazon.com .</p>

<p>Whenever  a query for the bouding box(Lets call it <strong>box original</strong> )  to get lat/lng for the markers is made , we have to add a delta value to that bounding box(Lets call it <strong>box modified</strong> ) . So the results from server includes results of a bigger bounding box. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>box original</strong> &lt; <strong>box modified</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/public/images/overquery_map.png" alt="My helpful screenshot"></p>

<p>When the user pans within the <strong>box modified</strong> , no need for querying since we already have the results fetched during the previous query. Only when the user pans outside the <strong>box modified</strong> we need to query again , which again follows the same procedure as above .</p>

<p>So,now when the user pan around the map ,the panning will be smooth and thats how <strong>Problem(b)</strong> was solved</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">Performance Boost</h3>

<p>We were very close to put this into production and then we started looking under the hood. The latency was not really high but notable .</p>

<p>The reason behind this is the data-exchange format we had , it was <strong>KML(Keyhole markup language)</strong> . we used this because 
there was a pretty KML parser( :P )  available so it is was easy for us to handle data.</p>

<p>we switched from KML to JSON , and this gave us a solid decrease in the latency.Of course , few big parts of the app has to be
rewritten and i did that too. I wrote the <strong>full stack(client+server)</strong> so it was not hard for me.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">Finally we shipped</h3>

<p>The app exists in <strong>rails-cells</strong> integration inside komparify.com . Also , i have a version hosted here </p>
