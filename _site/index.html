<h2 id="toc_1">What is Chatminion ?</h2>

<p>Better explained in the video.
    <iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CuVyldcQ0Kw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>It is  a comprehensive chat application, that is made for chatting inside an office. You can send text messages and video calls.
But there is a catch , you dont have to type and send messages , neither the reciepient . Curated set of messages , which are used more than 100 times in a day within a team or office are right inside the app.</p>

<p>Once you send a message, your reciepient will be shown with most possible replies to the message . Chatminion will also prepare an audio message based on the message you send and recieve(Its not just a message read out).</p>

<h4 id="toc_2">Some of the highlights include</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>98% ephemeral , your message flies from one end to the other and dies right there. It gets stored nowhere.
 The application stores only last two messages for threading(to remember the context). </p></li>
<li><p>Makes the recurring conversions , really quick .</p></li>
<li><p>Make video calls , the reciepient need not authorize the video call .when you want to talk to your team member , simply hit video call and you are there .</p></li>
<li><p>Video calls are plugin free and based on Web RTC and it is almost Peer to Peer .</p></li>
<li><p>The operational cost in the server side is extremely low . since no message gets stored anywhere.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="how-chatminion-works">
</div>

<h2 id="toc_3">How chatminion works ?</h2>

<p>You can study that here . <a href="https://github.com/dineshswamy/chatminion-chrome-app">Chatminion(repo)</a> . You are welcome , to hack away that , all instructions are available there .</p>

<div id="is-this-an-alternative">
</div>

<h2 id="toc_4">Is this an alternative to other chat applications ?</h2>

<p>May or may not be , depends on the needs you have. We wrote this exclusively for people who work in teams .Teams that does development or looks after sales etc . We  have no intention of competing in the chat applications space .</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="toc_5">We are experimenting to see whether chatting really works this way and the results of the experiment are yet to come .</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Three months ago , i made a prototype working . It was working but  it was incomprehensible to distribute . Thats where we decided , okay lets make this is as a complete google chrome app and see what happens .</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="toc_6"><em>Doing a feature comparison between existing chat applications and Chatminion , wont fit. Chatminion is one of its kind . Though , It is still a tool for making conversation , the way  conversation happens is different .</em></h4>
</blockquote>

<p>But there are clear differences , and what chatminion can do </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Chatminion is not based on XMPP protocol its built on top of HTTP </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every message that is sent via chatminion can be attached a property with it( attribute )</strong> i.e The sender can control the behaviour and appearance of the message that is sent .You can do something like , </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Okay chatminion .  i dont want any reply from him/her for this message &quot; , by turning off the check box .</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>if you dont want chatminion to prepare an audio message for your reciepient , you can do that , by turning off the check box</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div id="who-asked-you">
</div>

<h2 id="toc_7">Who asked you to write this ?</h2>

<p><strong>Nobody.</strong> Every day these things keep happening at my office </p>

<p>Everyday ,i saw my manager entering office and the first thing he asks me is this &quot;Whats your status ?&quot; and depending on the day , my reply would be &quot;Completed&quot; or &quot;Still working&quot; or &quot;need some time&quot; .</p>

<p>There is another manager ,who oversees sales team . every half n hour , he will shout(loud enough to be heard by everyone) at  his sales team &quot; XYZ ? Can we talk now ?&quot; and the reply would    be &quot;In 10 mins&quot; or &quot;Later&quot; or &quot;I m on call . will be coming&quot;</p>

<p>and finally my colleague </p>

<p>He ll be in another room , and he wont come out of his place very often .
he will shout whatever he wants to ask me and most of the time , i ll be wearing earphones , so the rest of the story is obvious. Someone will tap my shoulder,i ll remove my earphones , ask them what and blah blah .</p>

<p>I would like to thankyou for reading this post . I once again quote that</p>

<p>We made chatminion , because we imagined chatting this way will be intresting and i requote the following  </p>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>Today , i completed a course on coursera . For a very long time , i wanted to accomplish these
two things . Polish my algorithm skills . Complete a course on coursera .</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Not everything came true</h3>

<p>Some part of was satisfied , that i was able to complete the course . But unfortunately i wont be able to recieve the certificate of accomplishment . The base score to get a certificate of accomplishment is <code>70</code> , i managed to score only <code>66</code> .The following is the score summary</p>

<ul>
<li>Final exam 30 out of 40</li>
<li>Programming assignments 23 out of 30</li>
<li>Problem sets 13 out of 30</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes , I hate giving and recieving lame excuses . But this one is out of my hands .
Obviously , my problem sets sucked in accomplishment certificate . The fact is only after several deadlines , i happen to know that there exists a section called problem set .</p>

<p>But never mind , i m planning to take the sequel course .</p>

<p>Thanks for reading :P </p>

        Towermapify - Coverage maps for komparify.com
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2014</span>

    <p>This blog post is about my internship project at komparify.co and  the development challenges i&#39;ve encountered in making this.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="toc_0">What towermapify does ?</h2>

<p>Towermapify is a coverage map. The objective is to map  coverage strength of all the operators in india .
Whether they provide 3G or 4G or HSIA(high speed internet connectivity) in a particular region . If a user
needs to know whether 3G/4G/HSIA is available in a region ? or How good the coverage strength of particular operator is ? , the information can be found .</p>

<p><a href="http://towermapify.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Towermapify</a></p>

<h2 id="toc_1">1 internship month =  1 prototype throwaway + 1 Production version</h2>

<p>When i was briefed about the project , neither of us had no clue how we are going to do this .We only had data required for the map .</p>

<p>We started with Google Maps API combined with Google FusionTables . Your data will be hosted by the Google Servers .It will provide REST FULL apis to access the data . You need to write a client(HTML+CSS+JS) where you need to handle the data and put them in Map.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Growing requirements</h3>

<p>Once i got a prototype working , the requirements at komparify.com started growing , we badly required many features . But Fusion tables are not enough as they had limitations.</p>

<p>For example : You cant do a &quot;OR&quot; in the SQL query you send .Your table should be publicly available .</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Thrown far far away</h3>

<p>So days and days of work was thrown away and we finally settled down to define development stack.We decided use our own servers and make restful apis for data .</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Towermapify - Built on</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails </li>
<li>Google maps API V3</li>
<li>KML/JSON</li>
<li>HTML+CSS+JS</li>
<li>Rails Cells integration </li>
<li>MySQL</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_5">OverQuery algorithm</h2>

<h3 id="toc_6">Problem (A)</h3>

<p>We have a huge data containing latitude and longitude information of places all over india . if we
drop markers for all the places , it will do a catastropic damage to the performance,browser.
Takes huge memory , not a good idea.</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Work around (A)</h3>

<p>So , to decide what markers to drop . we get the bounding edges south west and north east of the map . With that , the query is for only the  places that resides inside the bounding box and then query again when the user does panning inside the map , with the new bounding box</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">Problem (B)</h3>

<p>The way we find the new bounding box after the user pans is by listening to the map-events . But the problem is that map-events fire for every small pan or zoom , making navigation inside maps terrible . If the mouse is just shaken inside the map , it does a query for the new bounding box and drops the markers again , giving a terrible user experience .
Also , server-client IO will be high .</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">Work around (B)</h3>

<p>This is the place where we went back to the drawing board and started writing rules that minimizes no of requests to the server and gives a good user experience .</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">Overquery</h3>

<p>My boss and co-founder of komparify.com Jigar doshi , formulated this approach.He knew of this approach thourgh his
experience at Amazon.com .</p>

<p>Whenever  a query for the bouding box(Lets call it <strong>box original</strong> )  to get lat/lng for the markers is made , we have to add a delta value to that bounding box(Lets call it <strong>box modified</strong> ) . So the results from server includes results of a bigger bounding box. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>box original</strong> &lt; <strong>box modified</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/public/images/overquery_map.png" alt="My helpful screenshot"></p>

<p>When the user pans within the <strong>box modified</strong> , no need for querying since we already have the results fetched during the previous query. Only when the user pans outside the <strong>box modified</strong> we need to query again , which again follows the same procedure as above .</p>

<p>So,now when the user pan around the map ,the panning will be smooth and thats how <strong>Problem(b)</strong> was solved</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">Performance Boost</h3>

<p>We were very close to put this into production and then we started looking under the hood. The latency was not really high but notable .</p>

<p>The reason behind this is the data-exchange format we had , it was <strong>KML(Keyhole markup language)</strong> . we used this because 
there was a pretty KML parser( :P )  available so it is was easy for us to handle data.</p>

<p>we switched from KML to JSON , and this gave us a solid decrease in the latency.Of course , few big parts of the app has to be
rewritten and i did that too. I wrote the <strong>full stack(client+server)</strong> so it was not hard for me.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">Finally we shipped</h3>

<p>The app exists in <strong>rails-cells</strong> integration inside komparify.com . Also , i have a version hosted here </p>
