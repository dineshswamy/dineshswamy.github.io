Today , i completed a course on coursera . For a very long time , i wanted to accomplish these
two things . Polish my algorithm skills . Complete a course on coursera .

### Not everything came true 

Some part of was satisfied , that i was able to complete the course . But unfortunately i wont be able to recieve the certificate of accomplishment . The base score to get a certificate of accomplishment is `70` , i managed to score only `66` .The following is the score summary

* Final exam 30 out of 40
* Programming assignments 23 out of 30
* Problem sets 13 out of 30

Sometimes , I hate giving and recieving lame excuses . But this one is out of my hands .
Obviously , my problem sets sucked in accomplishment certificate . The fact is only after several deadlines , i happen to know that there exists a section called problem set .

But never mind , i m planning to take the sequel course .


Thanks for reading :P
