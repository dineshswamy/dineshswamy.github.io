##What is Chatminion ?

Better explained in the video.
	<iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CuVyldcQ0Kw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It is  a comprehensive chat application, that is made for chatting inside an office. You can send text messages and video calls.
But there is a catch , you dont have to type and send messages , neither the reciepient . Curated set of messages , which are used more than 100 times in a day within a team or office are right inside the app.

Once you send a message, your reciepient will be shown with most possible replies to the message . Chatminion will also prepare an audio message based on the message you send and recieve(Its not just a message read out).

####Some of the highlights include
* 98% ephemeral , your message flies from one end to the other and dies right there. It gets stored nowhere.
	 The application stores only last two messages for threading(to remember the context). 

* Makes the recurring conversions , really quick .

* Make video calls , the reciepient need not authorize the video call .when you want to talk to your team member , simply hit video call and you are there .

* Video calls are plugin free and based on Web RTC and it is almost Peer to Peer .

* The operational cost in the server side is extremely low . since no message gets stored anywhere.

##Is this an alternative to other chat applications ?

May or may not be , depends on the needs you have. We wrote this exclusively for people who work in teams .Teams that does development or looks after sales etc . We  have no intention of competing in the chat applications space .

>###We are experimenting to see whether chatting really works this way and the results of the experiment are yet to come . 


Three months ago , i made a prototype working . It was working but  it was incomprehensible to distribute . Thats where we decided , okay lets make this is as a complete google chrome app and see what happens .

>####*Doing a feature comparison between existing chat applications and Chatminion , wont fit. Chatminion is one of its kind . Though , It is still a tool for making conversation , the way  conversation happens is different .*

But there are clear differences , and what chatminion can do 


+ Chatminion is not based on XMPP protocol its built on top of HTTP 


+ **Every message that is sent via chatminion can be attached a property with it( attribute )** i.e The sender can control the behaviour and appearance of the message that is sent .You can do something like , 

>  *Okay chatminion .  i dont want any reply from him/her for this message " , by turning off the check box .*
   
Also
 

>   *if you dont want chatminion to prepare an audio message for your reciepient , you can do that , by turning off the check box*

##Who asked you to write this ?
**Nobody.** Every day these things keep happening at my office 


Everyday ,i saw my manager entering office and the first thing he asks me is this "Whats your status ?" and depending on the day , my reply would be "Completed" or "Still working" or "need some time" .

There is another manager ,who oversees sales team . every half n hour , he will shout(loud enough to be heard by everyone) at  his sales team " XYZ ? Can we talk now ?" and the reply would 	be "In 10 mins" or "Later" or "I m on call . will be coming"

and finally my colleague 

He ll be in another room , and he wont come out of his place very often .
he will shout whatever he wants to ask me and most of the time , i ll be wearing earphones , so the rest of the story is obvious. Someone will tap my shoulder,i ll remove my earphones , ask them what and blah blah .

I would like to thankyou for reading this post . I once again quote that


>We made chatminion , because we imagined chatting this way will be intresting and i requote the following
